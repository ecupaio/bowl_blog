This is the easiest lunch bowl I make. It requires very little work, tastes great, and it plenty filling.

My wife makes amazing bread so I usually take a slice with me to soak up the sauce, but (patronizing Ina Garten voice) store-bought is fine.

Though I love making my own sauce, Victoria makes an amazing jarred vodka sauce and some weekends I don't wanna cook. In summer when my basil is in full production, I'll make pesto for this dish. Spaghetti squash can hold up to any sauce so there's no limits.

Keeping the peas frozen prevents them from over cooking and losing their sweet taste. I find the peas go best with a red sauce since tomatoes are acidic and can get balanced out by the sweetness of the peas.
