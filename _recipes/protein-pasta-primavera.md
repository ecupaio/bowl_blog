Using protein pasta instead of regular pasta will help you keep full without extra carbs. You can usually find it in the health food aisle at your grocery. I prefer penne since it creates the perfect bite with the vegetables. I've found that the lentil pasta has the best, most neutral flavor. Chickpea can be a bit overpowering for this light dish.  

I prefer pecorino to parmesan because it's stronger and more flavorful than parmesan. Also, since it's less known it tends to be a higher quality then the mass produced parmesan that your grocery has.

You can use lemon pepper instead of zesting the lemons, but the fresh stuff makes all the difference.
