notes: |-
  Using a wok for the peppers and onions works really great, especially when you're dealing with a large quantity.

  You can do plain white rice instead of the Spanish rice. It's less works

  The tajin seasoning and mojo marinade can be made at home. For the seasoning, just use chili power, salt, and fresh lime juice. For the marinade, follow [this recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/75249/mojo-grilling-marinade/)
