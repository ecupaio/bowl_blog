Drunken noodle (Pad Kee Mao) is my go to Thai dish to cook because it doesn't hold back on anything: you're getting soy, oyster sauce, and chilis to the face and the ingredients and prep are simple. It is named that way because it's food made for drunk people so there are no rules on how to make it! Most Thai dishes, when properly cooked take thoughtful care into ingredients and prep. [Watch Gordon Ramsey](https://youtu.be/DsyfYJ5Ou3g?t=115) get read to filth for his subpar Pad Thai or [read this story](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/01/16/681944292/in-home-of-original-sriracha-sauce-thais-say-rooster-brand-is-nothing-to-crow-ab) about a Thai grandma that cured salt FOR A YEAR to create the most perfect Sriacha sauce in order to get a sense of the serious thought and effort that goes into Thai food. You have to consider, Thai people have been working with their core ingredients since the dawn of agriculture and us Westerners didn't get spices outside of salt and vegetables like peppers and tomatoes until we landed in the Americas so put respect on their dishes and create them with care.

Cooking tofu separately prevents it from becoming a crumbly mess when you are tossing all of the ingredients.

Thai Basil is tough to source so don't worry if you can't find it. Regular basil works fine too or you can forgo the basil entirely. Do whatever you want, I'm not a cop.
