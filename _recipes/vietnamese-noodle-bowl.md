Vietnamese food is perfect for lunch bowls:  It's light, mostly vegetarian, and relatively simple to prepare. Most of the recipes use fresh ingredients plucked straight from the garden, making it ideal for spring and summer meals. There isn't a name for this dish in particular; it's just Vietnam's version of meat and potatoes, i.e. good working people food.  

Slice cucumber and green onion day of consumption so they don't get slimy in the fridge all week.

Thai basil might be hard to find but regular basil does the job just fine too. I've also seen mint used in these types of noodle bowls too.

That dressing is gonna smell strong but it will taste awesome. Apply sparingly.

When I first did this bowl, I added some mushrooms saut√©ed in rice wine and sesame oil. They're very good but they add an extra step and you need a ton of mushrooms to make it worth while and they take away from the simplicity and elegant flavors of the bowl.
