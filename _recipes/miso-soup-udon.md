Dashi is stock made based from seaweed and fish (dried bonito flake to be specific) and miso is a fermented bean paste. When you put these two things together you have miso soup: a light, yet flavorful soup that's perfect for lunch.

Silken tofu is silky smooth like the name suggests. It's perfect for soup and I use the firm version so it can hold up to spooning into containers and travel.

Udon and tofu do the work of keeping you full and satisfied. I like Udon noodles because they are thick and stand up to hot soup. Plus, all the fun you will have slurping. Bucatini (thick spaghetti) works too or you can use ramen if you wish to stay within Japanese cuisine.

Seaweed snacks may seem like an odd thing, but they are really tasty alternatives to chips. Since seaweed has naturally occurring glutamate (the G in MSG), they have a nice umami flavor like their Frito-Lay counterparts. I get mine from an Asian grocery, but I have seen them at Trader Joe's and Costco. Look for them in the hippy, natural aisle.

Microwaveable quart containers are a great storage solution for both wet and dry goods. They stack when you aren't using them, they're durable, dishwasher-safe, and can go in the freezer. You can get them online or at a restaurant supply store.
