effort: 3
ingredients:
- 1 pork loin pack or center cut pork chops
- 2 cases of cherry or grape tomatoes
- 1 bag of fresh green beans
- 2 large onions
- 1 bulb of garlic
- 1 bag of snacking peppers or three bell peppers
- 1 bag of small roasting potatoes (red, Yukon gold, purple potatoes)
notes: |-
  Snacking peppers are typically cheaper than large bell peppers and you get more of a color variety, but they are more difficult to process since you need to remove the membrane and seeds of several tiny peppers rather than just doing three. I also like to use the left over peppers for salads with greens during the week.

  Potatoes matter! Aldi sells a little bag (as do most groceries in my area) of mixed potatoes. They are a little bit more expensive than your regular Idaho russet, but they taste better and have more nutrients.

  You can swap pork loin for chickpeas if you are vegetarian/vegan. Just roast them along with everything else, the liquid from the tomatoes and green beans will keep them from drying out.

  Good paprika comes in a tin. If it isn't in a tin, it's just red dust. Treat yourself and get some nice spices so bringing lunch doesn't seem like a sacrifice.

  Meat thermometers are a kitchen essential and are available at grocery stores. This eliminates the guess work of touching the meat, or worse, cutting it open to see if it's done.

  You don't need a cast-iron pan for the pork. Just sear in a regular pan and transfer to a roasting dish for the oven portion.

  Roasting the vegetables with the potatoes allows the potatoes to suck up some of the excess juices of the tomatoes and makes for some truly delicious papas.

Pre-heat your oven to 425 degrees.
Rub your pork loin in oil, then apply a spice rub of paprika, lemon pepper, oregano, and salt.
Wash your potatoes and chop them in half so they cook quicker.
Coat a deep baking dish with olive oil and place your potatoes. You should have room left over to add the other vegetables later on.
Season potatoes with rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper.
Roast potatoes for 30 minutes.
Take your pork loin out of the fridge so it gets to room temperature before cooking.
While your potatoes roast, prep the rest of your vegetables
Slice your tomatoes in half so they don't explode in your mouth when you eat.
Chop green beans in half for bite sized pieces.
Dice your onions.
Crush your garlic cloves to remove the skin and leave as is. You can chop them up, but I love a roasted clove more than anything.
After 30 minutes of roasting, toss your potatoes if they are crisp on the bottoms and lift easy. If not, give them some more time.
Add the rest of the vegetables to the baking dish and let roast for another 15-20 minutes or until potatoes are soft.
Once the vegetables are done, lower the oven to 350 degrees.
Get a cast-iron pan on the stove hot (high heat) with some vegetable oil or other high-smoke point oil.
Sear each side of the loin to a golden brown, then put the pork loin in the oven for ab out 30-45 minutes or until temperature reaches 145 degrees.
Let your meat rest so the pork loin can continue cooking for a bit on the counter. Once the meat is cooled enough to handle, slice into bite sized cubes for your bowl.
Store the pork in a separate container and pour the jous on top.
To arrange your bowls, put down a generous layer of veggies and potatoes then add the pork on top.
