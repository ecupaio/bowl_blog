## About me

A few years ago I started getting very bad heartburn. My doctor suggested taking a pill every day and not eating like a garbage can. I noticed continuing to eat like a garbage can while on my medication made me feel awful, even though I didn't get heartburn anymore, so I started looking into healthier ways to eat. I always cooked for myself, but I didn't know a whole lot about food outside of fatty meats and carbs. My wife, Jess, is an accomplished scientist that knows all about plants and their benefits so I turned to her to help with healthier recipes I started feeling better and went off my medication since my gut was in a much better place. I still love my meats, cheeses, and carbs, but now I'm able to do less and on occasion without suffering the loss of flavor.

## The purpose of this blog

I want you to be able to make healthy lunches for yourself so I created a space where I can share what I make every week. Each recipe is scaled for leftovers throughout the work week. My ingredients lists are written in a shopping list format so you can pick up everything you need at the store. I don't include measurements, only quantities of raw ingredients, because I want you to use your sense of smell and taste to determine how much of a spice you add or what ratio of raw ingredients to include to create harmony in a dish. Also I have no idea what a quart is and I never measure when I'm cooking so I cannot honestly tell you how much paprika to put in.

Shout-out to Cliff for helping me come up with a pun title for this blog.
